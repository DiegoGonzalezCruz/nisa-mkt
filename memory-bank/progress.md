# Project Progress: Nisa Marketing Website

## Current Status: In Progress

The project is currently in the development phase. The initial frontend structure is in place, and we are now focused on implementing the backend functionality for the pilot application form.

## What Works:

- The main marketing website is rendering correctly.
- The "Join the Pilot" modal opens and displays the application form.

## What's Left to Build:

- **API Endpoint:** The serverless function to handle form submissions needs to be created.
- **Frontend Integration:** The form needs to be connected to the new API endpoint.
- **Local Development Setup:** The Vite proxy and a method for running the serverless function locally need to be configured.
- **End-to-End Testing:** The entire form submission flow needs to be tested to ensure it works as expected.

## Known Issues:

- Currently, the form submission is a simulation. This will be replaced with the actual API call.
