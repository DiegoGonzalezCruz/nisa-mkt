# Product Context: Nisa Marketing Website

## The Problem

Instructional coaching is a high-impact practice for improving teaching quality, but it's often constrained by time and resources. Coaches struggle to provide continuous, personalized support to teachers between in-person sessions. This leads to a disconnect between professional development and daily classroom practice.

## The Solution

Nisa is an AI-powered platform that bridges this gap. It provides tools for coaches to:

- **Extend their reach:** Offer asynchronous support and resources.
- **Personalize learning:** Tailor feedback and suggestions to individual teacher needs.
- **Streamline workflows:** Automate administrative tasks and focus on high-value coaching activities.

The marketing website is the first point of contact for potential users. It needs to clearly articulate this value proposition and create a compelling case for joining the pilot program.

## User Experience Goals

- **Clarity:** Visitors should immediately understand what Nisa is and who it's for.
- **Trust:** The website should project a professional and credible image.
- **Simplicity:** The pilot application process should be straightforward and frictionless.
