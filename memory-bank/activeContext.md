# Active Context: Nisa Marketing Website

## Current Focus: API Development

The current focus is on building out the API functionality for the marketing website. This includes handling form submissions and providing a health check endpoint for monitoring.

## Key Tasks:

1.  **Create the API Endpoint:** Develop a serverless function at `api/pilot/submit` to process the form data. (Completed)
2.  **Adapt the Logic:** Convert the provided Next.js example code to a format compatible with a standard Node.js serverless environment. (Completed)
3.  **Integrate with Frontend:** Update the `JoinPilotModal.tsx` component to send the form data to the new API endpoint. (Completed)
4.  **Configure Local Development:** Set up a proxy in `vite.config.ts` to allow the frontend to communicate with the local serverless function. (Completed)
5.  **Create Health Check Endpoint:** Add a `/api/health` endpoint to confirm the API is operational. (Completed)

## Decisions and Considerations:

- **Security:** The communication between our API endpoint and the Nisa intake service must be secured using a timestamp and a SHA256 HMAC signature, as demonstrated in the example code.
- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive information (API keys, secrets, URLs) will be managed through a `.env` file and should not be hardcoded.
- **Error Handling:** The API endpoint should include robust error handling to manage issues with data validation, the intake service, and other potential failure points.
